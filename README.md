# Summary

This is a small treebank of grammatical examples for Kyrgyz.
It is part of a parallel Universal Dependencies corpus containing 148 sentences across four Turkic languages, designed to facilitate cross-linguistic research on these related languages.

# Introduction

The Kyrgyz-TueCL treebank is part of a parallel Universal Dependencies corpus containing 148 sentences across four Turkic languages (Turkish - [UD_Turkish-TueCL](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Turkish-TueCL/tree/dev), Azerbaijani - [UD_Azerbaijani-TueCL](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Azerbaijani-TueCL/tree/dev), Kyrgyz -  [UD_Kyrgyz-TueCL](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Kyrgyz-TueCL/tree/dev), and Uzbek - [UD_Uzbek-TueCL](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Uzbek-TueCL/tree/dev)), designed to facilitate cross-linguistic research on these related languages.

Total sentences: 173
Total tokens: 1250
Unique word forms (types): 464
Unique lemmas: 287

The Kyrgyz-TueCL treebank consists of 173 carefully selected sentences compiled from multiple sources, including the [Cairo corpus](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/cairo) (20 sentences), the [UDTW23 corpus](https://github.com/ud-turkic/udtw23) (20 sentences), and 97 additional examples illustrating specific grammatical constructions of interest. It serves as a source treebank for a parallel corpus spanning four Turkic languages from distinct branches of the family: Turkish and Azerbaijani (Oghuz), Kyrgyz (Kipchak), and Uzbek (Karluk).

The treebank includes various syntactic phenomena relevant to Turkic languages, such as pro-drop constructions, auxiliary chains, postverbal structures, and non-canonical word orders. Each sentence has been manually annotated following UD guidelines, with particular attention to morphosyntactic features that highlight both shared typological characteristics and language-specific traits.
Glossing, transliteration, and translations of all sentences are provided in Azerbaijani, Turkish, Uzbek, and English as metadata to support comparative research.

Dependency relations, glossing, lemmatization, morphological features, POS tagging, tokenization, and transliteration were manually annotated.

This resource is significant as it represents the first fully aligned parallel UD treebanks for these Turkic languages, enabling systematic cross-linguistic comparisons previously hindered by the lack of parallel resources. The treebank supports research in comparative Turkic syntax, cross-lingual parsing, and language education.
